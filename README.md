# About Me

My career has spanned through multiple industries, from a degree in Environmental Engineer to discovering my passion to become a Full-Stack Web Development.

I was born in California but was raised in Brazil. After earning my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in 2018, I moved back to US. By acquiring experience in a variety of industries: aerospace, retail, waste management and even film, I discovered a passion for programming. Throughout those roles I developed a strong attention to detail, a comfort in analyzing data, an ability to communicate with customers at all levels, and manage multiple tasks and deadlines.

Just before the pandemic began I was working in the aerospace industry and learning CNC Programming where I would write the code for machinery that made high precision airplane parts. Unfortunately, this path was severed due to Covid and I had to change course. This is when I dove head first into web development, which had become a passion of mine. I enjoy the constant challenges and learning that coding offers.

I am currently working on a Full Stack project that allows music fans to search for information about there favorite bands, albums and musicians.
